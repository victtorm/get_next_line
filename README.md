- This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C: static variables

 <h2>Get_next_line</h2>

Get next line function is a common function in many programming languages, especially in scripting languages and general-purpose programming languages such as C, C++, Python, etc. However, to be more specific, I'll talk about this function in the C language, which is a function used to read lines from a file or standard input (stdin). Here are some of the main uses of this function:

- Reading Text Files: Is often used to read text files line by line in C. It reads an entire line from a file, including whitespace, until it encounters a newline character (\n) or the end of the file.

- User Input Processing: It is common to use this function to process user input in a program. For example, when prompting the user to enter multiple lines of text, this function can be used to read each line individually.

- Dynamic String Manipulation Is useful for manipulating dynamic strings of unknown size. It automatically allocates enough memory to store the read line, making it easy to handle variable-sized strings.

- Data Parsing: In programs dealing with structured data in text format, such as CSV files or logs, this function can be used to parse and process these data line by line.

- Interacting with Other Programs: In some situations, it is necessary to interact with other external programs or processes, and this function can be useful for capturing the output of these programs line by line.

In summary, the get_next_line function is a versatile tool for handling text input in programs written in the C language, especially useful for reading text files and processing user input.
